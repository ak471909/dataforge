Machine Learning: An Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers 
to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to 
identify patterns and make predictions.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning with labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Applications:
Machine learning is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, 
natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and fraud detection.

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: The dataset used to teach the model
- Features: Input variables used for predictions
- Model: The mathematical representation of patterns
- Accuracy: Measure of how well the model performs
